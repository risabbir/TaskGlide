## How It Works

In its current version, TaskGlide operates exclusively in a **Guest-Only Mode**. This means:

-   **No Accounts Needed:** Get started immediately without signing up.
-   **Local Data Storage:** All your tasks, columns, and settings are saved directly in your web browser's `localStorage`. Your data stays on your device.
-   **Data Persistence:** Your information will be available as long as you use the same browser and don't clear your site data.

You can manage your guest session and clear data from the **Guest Info** page, accessible via the user icon in the header.

## Current Features

-   **Visual Kanban Board:** Organize tasks with drag-and-drop functionality across columns (To Do, In Progress, Done).
-   **Rich Task Details:** Add descriptions, priorities, due dates, tags, subtasks, and dependencies to your tasks.
-   **Time Tracking:** A simple start/stop timer for tasks in the "In Progress" column.
-   **Filtering & Sorting:** Easily find tasks with powerful filtering (by status, priority, due date, search term) and sorting options.
-   **Responsive Design:** Fully usable on both desktop and mobile devices with a dedicated bottom navigation for mobile.
-   **Light & Dark Mode:** Switch between themes to suit your preference.

### ‚ú® AI-Powered Features
